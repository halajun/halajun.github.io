# About Me

* I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [College of Engineering and Computer Science](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/) at [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/), advised by Dr. [Viorela Ila](http://viorelaila.net/) and Prof. [Robert Mahony](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~Robert.Mahony/). <br> 
[[My Curriculum Vitae]()] [[My Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=DSKW47kAAAAJ&hl=en)]
* My research interests lie in the area of robotic vision, particularly in visual odometry/SLAM, structure from motion, 3D vision, and motion field, etc.
* I received my B.Eng. and M.Sc. Degrees in [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/). My postgraduate research advisors are Prof. [Zhenbao Liu](http://www.liuzhenbao.com/) and Prof. [Shuhui Bu](http://www.adv-ci.com/blog/about-me/). During my master's period, I spent one and half years in the [Institute of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/english/home/index.htm), [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/) as a visiting researcher, supervised by Prof. [Zouhui Lian](http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/zlian/).
