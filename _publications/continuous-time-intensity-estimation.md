<b>Abstract.</b> Event cameras provide asynchronous, data-driven measurements of local temporal contrast over a large dynamic range with extremely high temporal resolution. Conventional cameras capture low-frequency reference intensity information. These two sensor modalities provide <i>complementary</i> information. We propose a computationally efficient, asynchronous filter that continuously fuses image frames and events into a single high-temporal-resolution, high-dynamic-range image state. In absence of conventional image frames, the filter can be run on events only. We present experimental results on high-speed, highdynamic-range sequences, as well as on new ground truth datasets we generate to demonstrate the proposed algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.
